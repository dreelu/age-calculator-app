## My process

### Built with

- JavaScript
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is my first project using JavaScript, so I've obviously learned a lot about it. It doesn't seem as difficult as I expected, and to be honest, I really enjoyed it. I'm very happy with my capabilities and feel like I'm starting to get really good at what I do.

### Continued development

I really want to learn more about JavaScript frameworks and APIs. It's a concept I've heard a lot about and when I found out what it means, it blew my mind. The possibilities are endless and I'd love to work with them as soon as possible!!

### Useful Resources

![ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) - First of all, I want to make it clear that I don't let AI do my job. I use it as if I were a senior dev, and I can answer questions like "How to use xyz in Tailwind" or "My body isn't scrolling. What do you think can be done?". Artificial intelligence is an extremely powerful tool when used well. If you don't want it to replace your work, don't take the first step.
